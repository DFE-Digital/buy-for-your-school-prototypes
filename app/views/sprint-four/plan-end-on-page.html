      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Tasks to help understand the needs and goals for the catering service.</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Understand the performance of the existing supplier and contract.</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Find out from {{ data["domain-expert"] }} what the existing contract offers and what it has been like working
      with that supplier. You may find it useful to focus on what has gone well and what can be improved? </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The aim of this step is to help you articulate your goal for this procurement in the specification
      builder.  You can find some guidance on this at <a href="www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/understanding-exisiting-contracts.html" class="govuk-link">
      www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/understanding-exisiting-contracts.html</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Review the finances for the current contract</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Catering contracts can be cost neutral or turn a profit for the school. Find out about the
      different types of catering contracts available at <a href="www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/different-types-of-catering-contracts.html" class="govuk-link">
      www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/different-types-of-catering-contracts.html</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You may also want to consider bringing catering in house, although this can be a time consuming
      process. More information can be found here <a href="www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/different-types-of-catering-contracts.html#in-house-catering" class="govuk-link">
      www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/different-types-of-catering-contracts.html#in-house-catering</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Find out what staff, governors and students want from a new catering service</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You may want to speak to the headteacher, governors and parent teachers association to find
      out what they want from a new catering contract. This may also help identify what key performance indicators (KPIs)
      you can use to monitor the new contract.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">It may be useful to ask the students what they think of the current catering services and what
      their needs are. This can be done through a student survey. More information can be found here
      <a href="www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/guidance/school-survey.html" class="govuk-link">
      www.gov.uk/buy-for-your-school/guidance/school-survey.html</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Understand the timeline </h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You identified that the new catering service needs to be in place and ready by 6 September
      2021. You will need to give notice on your current contract, find out what the notice period is and give notice at
      the appropriate time.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Contracts for complex services usually change during the easter or summer holidays, as the
      services will usually not be required during these periods. It also gives time to deal with any unforeseen
      circumstances.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You may also want to start thinking about how you want to transition from the old suppliers
      to the new.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Equipment and facilities audit</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Catering suppliers will need to know what equipment and facilities will be available to them.
      Understanding what the school and the current supplier can be complicated. You have identified Peter Hallam as the
      person to speak to about the current contract. You may also want to speak to the current supplier or locate the
      current contrac</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">New suppliers for catering may want to visit the school so that they can see the facilities
      and better understand the situation</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some existing equipment many need disposing of, this can be something that the new supplier
      helps with.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Review standards and legislation</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You need to understand what your obligations are and what they mean for your school. Find out
       where you can learn about relevant legislation. This may be from:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Identify ethical and environmental considerations</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your school may have policies or considerations regarding the ethical and environmental
      impact of the service you are looking to procure. The head teacher or governors may be able to help you understand
      these policies/considerations so that you can include them in the specification you will need to share with
      suppliers.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Find out if there are regional policies that will affect you procurement</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Be aware that there could be local policies that might apply to your school. We recommend
      speaking to your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/33379/Good+Food+and+Catering+Procurement+Policy+%28Framework%29+2018.pdf/d7f8f476-5a7b-cf17-19df-cb29f0b2dcb8">

      school’s buyer professional</a> network to see if you are subject to any local policies.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional contract requirements</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">There may be additional requirements for your catering contract outside of what you would
      consider business as usual. Your existing catering contract and Peter Hallam may be able to help you identify these
      requirements.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">They can include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          Special dietary requirements or allergies
        </li>

          Additional meals required during a normal school day

        </li>
        <li>
          Only paying for what is consumed
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Next steps</h2>
