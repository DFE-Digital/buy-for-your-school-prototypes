        Create a specification to procure a catering service for your school
      </h1>

      <p>This tool will help you to create a specification for a single school.</p>
      <p>A specification is a document which provides details about what your school wants a supplier to provide as part of a catering service.</p>
      <p>You can share the specification with suppliers to help them understand what the school wants to achieve.</p>
      <p>Suppliers can use this information to decide whether they are able to provide the service and if they are interested in working with your school.</p>
      <p>This service will guide you to provide your requirements for a new service. It will also automatically include standard requirements that all school catering suppliers must meet.</p>
      <p>You will be able to download an editable specification at the end of this tool.</p>
