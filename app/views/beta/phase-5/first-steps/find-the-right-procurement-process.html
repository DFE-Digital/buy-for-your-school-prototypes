<ul>
<li>details of the products and services available</li>
<li>an agreed pricing structure</li>
<li>details of the suppliers</li>
<li>instructions on how to buy</li>
<li>an agreed set of terms and conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Each framework tells you how to choose a supplier and place an order.</p>
<p>You will have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-procedures-and-procurement-law-for-schools/select-a-supplier-direct-from-a-framework-agreement'>Select the supplier from a list</a>.</li>

<p>Your school&rsquo;s procurement rules will set what class as high. We generally say high is over 40,000.</p>
