            <h3 class=\'govuk-heading-s\'>Lifetime cost of the catering contract</h3>

            <p>Catering contracts usually last 3 to 5 years, but that can vary. It's unlikely that the lifetime cost of the service will be low enough for you to choose a single supplier directly from a framework. You'll probably need to get at least 3 quotes, advertise a contract and run a procurement process, or run an EU compliant procurement process.</p>

            <p>There are <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-dfe-approved-framework-for-your-school'>3 catering services frameworks</a> available that you can use to run a mini competition, which involves asking 3 suppliers on the framework to quote.</p>

            <h3 class=\'govuk-heading-s\'>Time needed to run a catering procurement</h3>

            <p>When deciding your process, consider how much time you have to spend on the procurement. For example, running a compliant procurement process for catering can take around 6 months for a person or team with enough time to work on the procurement most days. Running your own procurement can also be a complex process, with a lot of different things to consider, but there is additional support available alongside this manual if you get stuck.</p>"

<p>Schools can work with their local authority or suppliers, but running the service in-house is another option. You may want to consider whether this is right for your school before you procure a contract. There are benefits and challenges to running the service yourself.</p>

<p>You might be able to:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
<li>increase uptake of school meals</li>

<li>respond quicker if your equipment is broken or faulty</li>
<li>develop staff skills through bespoke training</li>
<li>generate income by offering your catering services to other schools or nurseries</li>
<li>be in control of your expenditure</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=\'govuk-heading-s\'>Challenges</h3>
