            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Lifetime cost of the catering contract</h3>

            <p>Catering contracts usually last 3 to 5 years, but that can vary. It's unlikely that the lifetime cost of the service will be low enough for you to choose a single supplier directly from a framework. You'll probably need to get at least 3 quotes, advertise a contract and run a procurement process, or run an EU compliant procurement process.</p>

            <p>There is <a href=\"#\">1 catering services framework</a> available that you can use to run a mini competition, which involves asking 3 suppliers on the framework to quote.</p>

            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Time needed to run a catering procurement</h3>

            <p>When deciding your process, consider how much time you have to spend on the procurement. For example, running a compliant procurement process for catering can take around 6 months for a person or team with enough time to work on the procurement most days. Running your own procurement can also be a complex process, with a lot of different things to consider, but there is additional support available alongside this manual if you get stuck.</p>"
