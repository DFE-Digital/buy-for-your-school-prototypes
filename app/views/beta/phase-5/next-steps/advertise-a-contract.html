            html: "<p class='govuk-body'>You should have a &lsquo;clarification stage&rsquo; &ndash; a time when suppliers can ask questions. No matter who asks the question, in most cases you should generally:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>send the question and reply to all the bidders with the same information</li>
<li>anonymise the question, so no one knows who asked it</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not reveal copyrighted or sensitive information. Ask suppliers if they are happy for you to publish their question and your answer. If they say no, consider their request and give them the opportunity to withdraw the question if you do not agree.</p>
<p>We recommend that you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ask suppliers to email the questions</li>
<li>keep a log of the questions and the answers you gave</li>

<p>You must:</p>

<li>not open any bids before the deadline</li>
<li>treat all bids fairly and equally</li>
<li>record how you made your decisions so you can defend them if you have to</li>
<li>keep confidential, secure, auditable records</li>
<li>award the contract to the highest scoring bidder</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Who should assess the bids</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to have at least 2 people assess each bid. When they&rsquo;re finished they should compare their scores and:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>discuss where they&rsquo;ve scored differently</li>
<li>reach an agreed score</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called &lsquo;moderation&rsquo;. Be aware, the more people involved, the harder it can be to reach an agreed score.</p>
<p>Bring in a specialist if you need expert knowledge to assess criteria, such as a quantity surveyor for building projects or an expert in procurement law.</p>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Keeping records</h3>
<p>Keep a record of all scores, comments and moderation decisions. There&rsquo;s software you can buy or you can use a spreadsheet.</p>"

            html: "<p class='govuk-body'>Tell all unsuccessful bidders who won and tell them at the same time.</p>
<p>Your letter should include:</p>

<li>the name of the winning bidder</li>
<li>the award criteria you used</li>
<li>the scores for the winning bid</li>
<li>the relevant advantages of the winning bid</li>
<li>their scores and feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>If an unsuccessful bidder asks for the actual cost of the winning bid, you should provide it to them, provided that it will not give away any commercially sensitive information. There is no obligation to provide a detailed breakdown. You should:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>only comment on their unsuccessful bid &ndash; do not share details of anyone else&rsquo;s</li>
<li>try to give positive feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Our advice is to avoid feedback meetings. If you do decide to meet face-to-face, keep notes during the meeting and have more than 1 member of staff present.</p>
<p>The meeting cannot be used to reopen negotiations.</p>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Tell the winning bidder</h3>
<p>Write to them saying they won including:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the award criteria you used</li>
<li>their scores</li>
<li>why you think their bid is the most economically advantageous</li>
<li>feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>The letter is an invitation to finalise a contract. You need to make it clear that there are no commitments, and no work should begin, until both of you have signed the contract.</p>
<p>If for any reason they decide not to go ahead with the contract, you can award the contract to the second-highest scoring bidder, if you reserved the right to do so in your original tender documents, or you can rerun the process.</p>"

<p>The last copy of the terms and conditions sent by either side is the one that is legally binding, so make sure that you&rsquo;re the last to sign.</p>
<p>If you placed an advert in&nbsp;Contracts Finder, place a notice of your contract award there too.</p>
<p>Set up a meeting with the supplier to finalise the management and payment arrangements, clarify key performance indicators and agree how you will work together.</p>

<p>The later in the process you abandon your procurement the greater the risk of you receiving a legal challenge where bidders may seek reimbursement of their bid costs.</p>
<p>You should make sure that your tender documents make it clear that you have the right to abandon the process at any time without any liability to the bidders.</p>
