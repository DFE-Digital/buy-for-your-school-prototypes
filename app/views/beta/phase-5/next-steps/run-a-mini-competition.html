<h3 class=\'govuk-heading-s\'>Who should assess the bids</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to have at least 2 people assess each bid. When they&rsquo;re finished they should compare their scores and:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
<li>discuss where they&rsquo;ve scored differently</li>
<li>reach an agreed score</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is called moderation. Be aware, the more people involved, the harder it can be to reach an agreed score.</p>
<p>Bring in a specialist if you need expert knowledge to assess a criteria.</p>
<p>You may also ask the framework owner when they last ran a financial check on the supplier. Ask them to run a new one if needed.</p>
<h3 class=\'govuk-heading-s\'>Keeping records</h3>
<p>Keep a record of all scores, comments and moderation decisions. Frameworks usually have a system for this. There&rsquo;s also software you can buy or you can use a spreadsheet.</p>"
