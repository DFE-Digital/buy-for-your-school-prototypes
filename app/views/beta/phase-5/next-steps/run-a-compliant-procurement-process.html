<p>It is used to score and rank the suppliers so you can assess the top bids. Decide in advance how many bids you will assess &ndash; it must be at least 5.</p>
<p>Do this if:</p>

<li>the bid they have to supply will be particularly complicated or costly to write</li>

<li>find out if the supplier is suitable for the contract, not how they would handle the job</li>

<li>send the question and reply to all the bidders with the same information</li>
<li>anonymise the question, so no one knows who asked it</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not reveal copyrighted or sensitive information. Ask suppliers if they are happy for you to publish their question and your answer. If they say no, consider their request and give them the opportunity to withdraw the question if you do not agree.</p>
<p>We recommend that you:</p>

<li>keep a log of the questions and the answers you gave</li>

<li>record how you made your decisions so you can defend them if you have to</li>
<li>keep confidential, secure, auditable records</li>
<li>award the contract to the highest scoring bidder</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask people to clarify things in their bid if it is not clear. You must not negotiate over bids.</p>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Who should assess the bids</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to have at least 2 people assess each bid. When they&rsquo;re finished they should compare their scores and:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss where they&rsquo;ve scored differently</li>
<li>reach an agreed score</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called moderation. Be aware, the more people involved, the harder it can be to reach an agreed score.</p>
<p>Bring in a specialist if you need expert knowledge to assess criteria, such as a quantity surveyor for building projects or an expert in EU procurement law.</p>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Keeping records</h3>
<p>Keep a record of all scores, comments and moderation decisions. There&rsquo;s software you can buy or you can use a spreadsheet.</p>"

<li>the scores for the winning bid</li>
<li>the relevant advantages of the winning bid</li>

<p>If an unsuccessful bidder asks for the actual cost of the winning bid, you should provide it to them, provided that it will not give away any commercially sensitive information. There is no obligation to provide a detailed breakdown. You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>only comment on their unsuccessful bid &ndash; do not share details of anyone else&rsquo;s</li>
<li>try to give positive feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Our advice is to avoid feedback meetings. If you do decide to meet face-to-face, keep notes during the meeting and have more than 1 member of staff present.</p>
<p>The meeting cannot be used to reopen negotiations.</p>
<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Tell the winning bidder</h3>
<p>Write to them saying they won including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the award criteria you used</li>
<li>their scores</li>
<li>why you think their bid is the most economically advantageous</li>
<li>feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>The letter is an invitation to finalise a contract. You need to make it clear that there are no commitments, and no work should begin, until both of you have signed the contract.</p>
<p>If for any reason they decide not to go ahead with the contract, you can award the contract to the second-highest scoring bidder, if you reserved the right to do so in your original tender documents, or you can rerun the process.</p>"

<p>During the standstill period, if an unsuccessful bidder challenges the fairness of the contract award decision or process, you must contact them and explain that you&rsquo;ve conducted a fair assessment process and that you&rsquo;ve kept good records.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature and seriousness of the challenge you may want to get legal advice before responding.</p>

<p>The last copy of the terms and conditions sent by either side is the one that is legally binding, so make sure that you&rsquo;re the last to sign.</p>
