<p>It&rsquo;s best to have at least 2 people assess each quote. When they&rsquo;re finished they should compare scores and:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss where they&rsquo;ve scored differently</li>
<li>reach an agreed score</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware, the more people involved, the harder it can be to reach an agreed score.</p>
