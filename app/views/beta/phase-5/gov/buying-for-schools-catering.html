          <p>Your school must comply with Standards for school food in England.</p>
          <p>Before you start, it’s important to understand:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>how long buying catering services will take</li>
            <li>what steps you need to take</li>
            <li>how to plan any changes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The steps below can help you manage the changes you may want to make.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">End an existing contract</h2>
          <p>Find out your school’s existing catering contract:</h2>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>end date</li>
            <li>notice period</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This will help you to plan any changes if you decide to switch contract.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Talk to the staff involved</h2>
          <p>Before you make any changes, you should talk to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>school governors</li>
            <li>senior leadership team</li>
            <li>staff involved in school catering</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Before talking to your staff, you may need to <a href="">write a business case</a> for the senior leadership team and school governors.</p>

          <p>Try to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>keep your staff informed</li>
            <li>address any concerns your staff have</li>
            <li>be aware that staff may wish to contact their union</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Talk to other schools</h2>
          <p>You may find it helpful to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>ask other schools if they’re looking to renew their catering contract</li>
            <li>negotiate bulk deals and discounts with suppliers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This may help you to get better value and spread the workload with other schools.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Start a new contract</h2>
          <p>It’s best to start a new contract:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>at the beginning of the academic year</li>
            <li>after long school holiday, for example, Christmas or Easter</li>

          <p>Consider whether TUPE and LGPS will apply, especially if you’re looking to outsource or come away from your local authority for the first time.</p>
          <p>When you give notice of termination to your current provider, you should also request details of any staff that will be subject to TUPE transfer.</p>
          <p>This anonymised information should include:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>salary details
            <li>terms conditions
            <li>pension details
          </ul>
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">School meals data</h2>
          <p>You should also gather information such as free school meal numbers and school meal uptake. This information will form part of your business case and tender requirements.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Procurement threshold rules</h2>
          <p>If, over the lifetime of your contract, the value of your provision is over the EU Procurement threshold, you’ll need to use a framework agreement or carry out your own procurement and issue a tender using the Find a Tender service.</p>
          <p>You can get information on buying catering services from the Schools’ Buying Hubs:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Considerations when using a framework</h2>
          <p>The Department of Education (DfE) reviews a range of frameworks. These are assessed for:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>compliance with procurement regulations</li>
            <li>ease of use, suitability</li>
            <li>value for money</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The section below contains further considerations about using frameworks.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Further competition process</h2>
          <p>A framework may still require a ‘further competition’ process but this means you do not need to run a full Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) procurement process.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Supplier equipment</h2>
          <p>Consider:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>what equipment you own</li>
            <li>what the bidding suppliers will provide</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You may have to include the cost of buying new equipment. You should take independent legal advice if you’re unsure about what will be included.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks</h2>
          <p>You’ll need confirmation from suppliers that they’ve had the relevant DBS checks.</p>
          <p>It’s your responsibility to check that everyone involved in the catering contract is DBS checked.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Supplier samples</h2>
          <p>You may want to ask potential suppliers to produce sample meals for you to try as this will form part of your specification and tender requirements.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Supplier feedback</h2>
          <p>When selecting the suppliers, you may want to talk to other schools they serve and get feedback on the service they offer.</p>

          <p>The information below gives you advice on the benefits and challenges of in-house catering provision.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits</h2>
          <p>You may find you can:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>increase uptake of school meals</li>
            <li>negotiate better prices from suppliers</li>
            <li>increase food quality</li>
            <li>respond quicker if your equipment is broken or faulty</li>
            <li>develop staff skills through bespoke training</li>
            <li>generate income by offering your catering services to other schools or nurseries</li>
            <li>be in control of your expenditure</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Staff training</h2>
          <p>Consider how you will provide initial training on:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>food specifications</li>
            <li>menu building</li>
            <li>health and safety</li>
            <li>food hygiene</li>
            <li>food preparation skills</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Costs and spending</h2>
          <p>You should fully understand your costings so you can:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>plan for increased spending, for example, staffing, equipment, food and utilities</li>
            <li>plan for maintenance of equipment</li>
            <li>avoid expensive budgeting errors</li>
            <li>keep staff up to date with legislation and regulations by allowing time and money for on-going training</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Managing demand</h2>
          <p>You should:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>get regular feedback from parents, pupils and governors</li>
            <li>check you have enough dining space to accommodate increased demand</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">TUPE and LGPS</h2>
          <p>If you’re moving away from a local authority, you’ll need to obtain TUPE and LGPS information.</p>
          <p>There may be time frames around when the local authority is obliged to release this information.</p>
          <p>These time frames can cause delays and further expense if you award the contract without having the details.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Invite your local authority to tender</h2>
          <p>Invite your local authority to tender and involve them in the process. This way the TUPE and LGPS information must be provided during their bidding process.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks</h2>
          <p>It’s your responsibility to check that everyone involved in the catering contract is DBS checked.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Equipment and maintenance</h2>
          <p>Find out:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>what equipment the current provider may be repossess</li>
            <li>which maintenance contracts your provider covers</li>
            <li>whether maintenance checks are up to date</li>
