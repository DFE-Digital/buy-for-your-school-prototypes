    <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
      <li>get value for money</li>
      <li>comply with procurement law</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read <a href="">buying for schools</a> for advice on the types of goods and services schools regularly buy, such as catering and ICT hardware.</p>
    <p>On 31 December 2020, the <a href="">Find a Tender service</a> replaced Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) in the UK public procurement process. UK buyers who previously published OJEU notices on TED should now use the Find a Tender service. Notices published before this change are still on <a href="">TED.</a></p>
